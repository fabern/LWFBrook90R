LWFBrook90R v0.3.4 (Release date: 2020-08-28)
==============

Changes
* Adjusted 'table'-method in MakeRelRootDens: The root depth distribution provided in a table is now redistributed to the soil nodes under preservation of the total root mass.
* Input changed for soilnodes-argument of MakeRelRootDens. See ?MakeRelRootDens.

Bug fixes:
* zero division error causing infinite relawat values in MISCDAY.ASC-output.
* 'betamodel'-method of MakeRelRootDens returned the increment of the cumulative root proportion at the soil nodes, instead of the relative root density, which actually is the former value divided by the layer thickness.


LWFBrook90R v0.3.0 (Release date: 2020-04-21)
==============

Changes
* new function msiterunLWFB90()
* runLWFB90(): model input (param.b90, option.b90, standprop_daily) is appended
	to the return value BEFORE evaluating the output_fun-argument. In this way,
	on-the-fly post-processing of model results including model-input is possible now.
* minor bugs fixed


LWFBrook90R v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-06-18)
==============

Changes:
* minor bugs fixed
* 'output_fun' argument replaces 'gof_fun'-argument in runLWFB90() for more flexible output.


LWFBrook90R v0.1.0 (Release date: 2019-05-13)

 and arguments were renamed, and a lot of functionality was added.
